=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes as input a suburban, rural or postal address in free format
text such as,

    3080 28TH AVE N ST PETERSBURG, FL 33713-3810
    12 1st Avenue N Suite # 2 Somewhere CA 12345 USA
    C/O JOHN, KENNETH JR POA 744 WIND RIVER DR SYLVANIA, OH 43560-4317

    9 Church Street, Abertillery, Mid Glamorgan NP13 1DA
    27 Bury Street, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 3QT

    2A LOW ST KEW NSW 2123
    12/3-5 AUBREY ST MOUNT VICTORIA VICTORIA 3133
    "OLD REGRET" WENTWORTH FALLS NSW 2782 AUSTRALIA
    GPO Box K318, HAYMARKET, NSW 2000

 
and attempts to parse it. If successful, the address is broken
down into it's components and useful functions can be performed such as :

    converting upper or lower case values to title case (2A Low St Kew NSW 2123)
    extracting the addresses individual components      (2A,Low,St,KEW,NSW,2123)
    determining the type of format the address is in    ('suburban')


If the address cannot be parsed you have the option of cleaning the address
of bad characters, or extracting any portion that was parsed and the portion
that failed.

This module can be used for analysing and improving the quality of
lists of residential and postal addresses.
